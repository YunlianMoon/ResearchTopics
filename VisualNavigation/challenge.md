# Challenge

Our goal is to improve navigation in unseen scenes and towards novel objects:

- There is no mug in the field of view of the agent, but the likely location for finding a mug is the cabinet near the coffee machine.
- The agent has not seen a mango before, but it infers that the most likely location for finding a mango is the fridge since similar objects such as apple appear there as well.
