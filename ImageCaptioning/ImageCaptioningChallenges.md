# Image Captioning

### Challenges

#### Automatic description generation from images: A survey of models, datasets, and evaluation measures (survey, 2016)
- the description could in principle talk about any visual aspect of the image: it can mention objects and their attributes, it can talk about features of the scene (e.g., indoor/outdoor), or verbalize how the people and objects in the scene interact.
- More challenging still, the description could even refer to objects that are not depicted (e.g., it can talk about people waiting for a train, even when the train is not visible because it has not arrived yet) and provide background knowledge that cannot be derived directly from the image (e.g., the person depicted is the Mona Lisa).
